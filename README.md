# Machine Learning on Meshes
As part of my internship with Monumo, I worked on some cool models for predicting magnetic fields in motors from 3D surface meshes. Unfortunately, my code is in a private repository, and I can't share it publicly. I made this repository to share implementations of some of the papers studied in my internship, just used for classification on the ModelNet40 dataset, rather than being applied to electric motors.

## Implementation of PCT: Point Cloud Transformer paper
This repo contains my implementation of the SPCT model from this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09688
